# blockchain-voting
<p>Project for capstone course</p>
<p>Students: Trung, Aaron, Steve, Jesse, and John</p>
<p>While society strives to move forward technologically, cybersecurity is a huge concern, especially when it comes to using electronic machines for voting. Along with four other classmates, we are looking to address this issue with the implementation of blockchains for record keeping. Using a rasperry pi as a node and a physical polling station, we wanted to create something that would be affordable, portable and secure.</p>
